# Description of the annotation process
- For each document we annotated three things, all the skills required for the job, parent class/category of the job and the experience level required for the job.
- Each team member annotated around 140 documents (job descriptions). 
- Each document was annotated by exactly two team members separately, so that we could calculate inter-annotator agreement.
- We annotated a total of around 280 documents. 
- We tried to cover all the major categories in the data while selecting these documents.
# Creation of final annotation file from intermediary files
- For skills we took the union of all the skills identified by differnet annotators.
- For parent job class and experience, we manually resolved the confilting records.
