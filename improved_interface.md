# Improved Interface


Here are a few things we did to improve our interface and the functionality of our application :

1) Improvising our Search functionality : We had worked on some reverse index where every skills can be linked to the job description and every job description can be linked to every skills, This enables users to view at search by skills or by job title to understand the how the industry works.

2) Improvising users experience:

- The user can also look into the job description using a download button the interface.

- The user can use the LinkedIn link to go their specific job posting to understand how the annotations are done.

- We have made use of flask for making the web interface and connections, this has made us reduce the dependencies on other languages.

3) Word cloud:

- Users can understand, if a technology is having overlap with multiple job titles by using the word cloud technique.

- By searching the required technologies, we can understand which are the job title that the user can Apply for.
