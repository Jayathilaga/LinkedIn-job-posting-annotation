## Motivation 

Our goal is to let people find out which tools and skills are in demand for a specific role. To accomodate this, we have annotated the skills and job title of job descriptions to attain an annotated corpus.

## Data

We have a corpus of around 2250 job listings, where around 280 of them are annotated with the job class and the skills mentioned in the job description. We will be using accessing this data for the website.

## Search Functionality

1. Whole corpus : The user will be given the option to select a job title. On selection, all job listings for that job title will be shown. The user can click on a specific job listing to display the job description.

2. Annotated corpus : The user will be given the option to select a job title and optionally, a seniority level. On selection, the user will be shown the tools and skills which are most valued in that specific field. The user will also be given the option to input a set of skills/tools and will be shown job titles that match their skillset.
